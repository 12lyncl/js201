* You can geta copy of this code repository a couple of ways.
  * Preferably either
     1. use `git` to clone it:
        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/portsoc/js201.git

* From your new local copy of the code
  * Open `index.html` in a browser to see which tests fail.
  * Edit `index.js`; improving and adding code until all the tests pass.
  * You may also examine (but do not change) `test.js` to understand exactly what is being tested.
