# JavaScript Basics

1. Download a zip of this `basicjs` repository or (preferably) clone it thus:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/portsoc/ws_basicjs.git
```
2. From your new local `ws_basicjs` folder, open `index.html` in a browser to see which tests fail.
3. Edit `index.js`; improving and adding code until all the tests pass.
